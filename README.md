## About

This repository features a variety of C programs, from beginner to advanced levels. Each program demonstrates a specific concept or feature of the C programming language. The aim is to deepen my knowledge of C while sharing useful code examples with the community.


## Getting Started

To start using these programs, you'll need a C compiler on your system. Here's how to run a program from this repository:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saim0xt/Programs.git
   cd Programs
2. **Compile a program:**

   ```bash
   gcc program_name.c -o program_name
4. **Run the program:**

   ```bash
   ./program_name


**Program List**
Here are some of the programs included and it will be updated in time:

**Hello World Program:** A basic program that prints "Hello, World!" to the screen.
**Factorial Program:** A program to calculate the factorial of a number.
**Palindrome Checker:** A program to check if a string or number is a palindrome.
More programs will be added over time as I explore new concepts in C.
